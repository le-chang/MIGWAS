20273 genes loaded from ./minimgnt/data/AllHumanGeneChrPosStrandNames_RefSeq_hg19_072111.txt
1871 miRNAs loaded from ./minimgnt/data/AllHumanMiRNAChrPosStrandNames_miRBase_hg19_062413.txt

--remove-HLA: 308 genes and 18 miRNAs were removed.
              19965 genes and 1853 miRNAs will be used in the following analysis.

Pruned SNPs loaded from ./minimgnt/data/CEU_HapMap_pruned_SNPs_ChrNumPos_hg19_072111.txt
Hotspot boundaries loaded from ./minimgnt/data/hotspot_boundaries_b37_hg19_072111.txt

465301 SNPs loaded from ./example/RA_trans.chr12.pos.P.txt

Converted 465301 SNP p-values to z-score (0 SNPs were removed due to NA)

Calculated uncorrected "gene association score" from best SNP association z-scores per gene
20698 out of 21818 genes/mirs were not assigned the score.

Calculated corrected "gene association score" using step-wise multivariate linear regression analysis

Results were written to RA_trans.{gene, mir}.pval.txt
